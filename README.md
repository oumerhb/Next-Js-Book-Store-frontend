# Next Bookstore (Beta)

![Next Bookstore by Sat Naing](next-bookstore.png)

An e-commerce project for an online bookstore developed using NextJS 13 and its experimental `appDir`. Frontend UI is crafted with radix-ui and TailwindCSS. To manage server and client state, TanStack Query and Zustand are used respectively. StrapiCMS serves as the backend for this project.

> I designed the entire UI/UX using Figma and created the database design myself. Additionally, I developed this web application from scratch, handling all aspects of the development process.

## Features 🔥

- Responsive Design

## Installation 🔮

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satnaing/next-bookstore.git
```

Install dependencies for frontend:

```bash
cd next-bookstore && npm install
```

Install dependencies for backend:

```bash
cd backend && npm install
```

Start the frontend: (at the root /)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend && npm run develop
```

Open your browser and go to <http://localhost:3000>

## Important Note ⚠️

I have intentionally committed the `backend/.tmp/data.db` file to the GitHub repository. This is because I did not want to set up a separate database for the project and connect it to my free backend hosting. Please note that this approach is not recommended for production-level applications. In a real-world scenario, I would use a more robust DBMS like PostgreSQL, with proper hosting and security configurations.
